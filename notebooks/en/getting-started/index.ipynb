This course aims to present the approach to handling a dataset, the problems encountered, the solutions to overcome them, and the implications of these solutions.

Knowledge of models will be more necessary for interpreting results.\n",

        "However, even though it is relatively easy to use complex models with `Python`, it is very useful to have some background on them before embarking on a modeling approach. This is one of the reasons why modeling comes later in this course: in addition to involving advanced statistical concepts, it is necessary to have understood the stylized facts in our data to produce relevant modeling. A thorough understanding of data structure and its alignment with model assumptions is essential for building high-quality models.\n",
