        "a language for declaring data operations that has been around for over fifty years,\n",

        "However, the dataframe only recently became established in Python,\n",
        "thanks to the `Pandas` package created\n",

        "The rise of the `Pandas` library (downloaded over 5 million times\n",

        "\n",
        "`Pandas` has become essential in the `Python` ecosystem for *data science*.\n",
        "`Pandas` itself is built on top of the `Numpy` package, which is useful to understand\n",
        "to be comfortable with `Pandas`. `Numpy` is a low-level library\n",
        "for storing and manipulating data.\n",
        "`Numpy` is at the heart of the *data science* ecosystem because most libraries, even those\n",
        "handling unstructured objects,\n",
        "use objects built from `Numpy`[1].\n",
        "\n",
        "The `Pandas` approach, which provides a unified entry point for manipulating\n",
        "datasets of very different natures,\n",
        "has been extended to geographic objects with `Geopandas`.\n",
        "This allows for the manipulation of geographic data as if\n",
        "it were classic structured data. Geographic data and\n",
        "cartographic representation are becoming increasingly common with\n",
        "the rise of open localized data and geolocated *big-data*.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, structured data imported from flat files\n",
        "is not the only data source. APIs and *web scraping*\n",
        "allow for flexible downloading or extraction\n",
        "of data from web pages or specialized portals. These data, particularly\n",
        "those obtained through *web scraping*, often require a bit more data\n",
        "cleaning work, especially with character strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `Pandas` ecosystem thus represents a Swiss army knife\n",
        "for data analysis. This is why this course\n",
        "will cover it extensively.\n",
        "Before trying to implement an *ad hoc* solution, it is\n",
        "often useful to ask the following question: *“Could I do this\n",
        "with the basic functionalities of `Pandas`?”* Asking this question can\n",
        "prevent arduous paths and save a lot of time.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, `Pandas` is not\n",
        "suitable for handling large volumes of data.\n",
        "To process such\n",
        "data, it is recommended to use `Polars` or `Dask`, which adopt the logic of `Pandas` but\n",
        "optimize its functionality, `Spark` if you have suitable infrastructure, generally in\n",
        "big data environments, or\n",
        "`DuckDB` if you are willing to use SQL queries rather than a high-level library.\n",
