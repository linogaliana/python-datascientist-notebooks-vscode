        "that Romain Avouac and I teach in the third year at ENSAE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nevertheless, since data value creation in the form of applications is very\n",
        "common, it is useful, at a minimum, to mention the distinction between static\n",
        "sites and dynamic applications to provide the right approach and point to the\n",

        "that performs actions based on parameters chosen by the user\n",
        "on the page).\n",
        "\n",
        "There are primarily two paradigms for making\n",
        "these two elements interact. The key difference between these approaches is the servers they rely on. A static site runs on a web server, whereas `Streamlit` relies on a standard *backend* server. The main difference between these two types of servers lies in their function and usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A *web* server is specifically designed to store, process, and deliver web pages (the *front*) to clients. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, etc. Web servers listen for HTTP/HTTPS requests from user browsers and respond by sending the requested data. This doesn’t preclude having complex data processing steps or reactivity by embedding `JavaScript` in the application, but `Python` processing steps are done before the application is made available. For `Python` users, there are several static site generators before deployment via hosting on [`Github Pages`](https://pages.github.com/). The two most common ecosystems are [`Quarto Markdown`](https://quarto.org/) and [`Django`](https://www.djangoproject.com/), with the former being simpler to use and maintain than the latter. This site, for example, is built using `Quarto`, which ensures reproducibility of the presented examples and ergonomic, customizable formatting of the results.\n",
        "-   A standard *backend* server is designed to perform operations in response to a *front*, in this case, a *web* page. In the context of an application built with `Python`, this is a server with an appropriate `Python` environment to execute the code required to respond to any action taken by an application user. The code is executed on demand rather than once and for all, as in the previous approach. This paradigm allows for more application complexity but represents an additional challenge during the deployment phase. In the `Python` ecosystem, the two main tools for building such applications are [`Streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/) and [`Dash`](https://dash.plotly.com/), with the former being quicker to implement than the latter. More recently, the dominant `R` equivalent ecosystem, [`Shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/), has been adapted for `Python` by `Posit`.\n",

        "> dated online resources still exist for developing applications with `tkinter`.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it comes to building applications, the first instinct should be: *“Do I need to build a reactive application, or will a static site suffice?”* The latter is much easier to implement and has minimal maintenance overhead, making it a rational choice in many cases. If building a static site becomes complex, for example, due to sophisticated calculations that would be difficult to implement without `JavaScript` skills, you can then consider separating the *front* from the *back* by delegating the calculations to an API, for example, built using [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). This can be a practical method to deploy a machine learning model, as will be discussed in the final chapter of the modeling section. If implementing an API seems too complicated or overkill for the task, then you can turn to a reactive application like `Streamlit`.\n",
